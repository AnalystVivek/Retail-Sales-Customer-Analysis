Key Findings & Business Recommendations

Focus on the Core Demographic: The primary customer base consists of women in the "Adults" age group. Marketing campaigns, product designs, and promotions should be specifically tailored to this high-value segment.

Optimize Top-Performing Products: The "Set" and "Kurta" categories are the main revenue drivers. Inventory management should prioritize keeping best-selling SKUs (like JNE3797-KR) and popular sizes (M, L, XL) well-stocked, especially leading up to peak months.

Leverage Key Sales Channels: Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart are the most effective sales channels. The business should strengthen partnerships with these platforms and analyze their strategies to potentially apply them to underperforming channels.

Target High-Value Geographic Markets: Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, along with cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Delhi, are the most lucrative markets. Targeted marketing efforts and logistical focus in these regions could yield a high return on investment.

Capitalize on Seasonal Peaks: Sales peak significantly in March. The business should plan major marketing campaigns, new product launches, and ensure full inventory levels in the preceding months to maximize revenue during this critical period.
